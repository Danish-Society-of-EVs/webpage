Analysis of particles between 450-800 nm require authorization from the FACS Core Facility. Particles above 800 nm cannot be acquired on this instrument.\n\n#### Whom to contact\n\nFACS Core Facility at Aarhus University\\\n<https://biomed.au.dk/research/core-facilities/facs-core-facility>\n\n#### Access\n\nPaid access or service\n",

      "body": "#### Description\n\nWe have two approaches: genetic engineering of endogenous EVs with a fluorescent reporter and microinjection of (fluorescently labelled) EVs including, but not limited to, human-derived EVs. In both cases, EVs are imaged in live zebrafish embryos using optical microscopes to study the secretion & uptake kinetics (via transgenesis), biodistribution (if microinjected), and interactions with cells of interest (e.g. macrophages and endothelial cells). Our genetic approach is not just about fluorescent labelling; we can engineer EVs in any way through transfection of zebrafish embryos to obtain in vivo results within a week. Collaborations on tissue injury models and EV injections are welcome!\n\n#### Whom to contact\n\nYuya Hayashi\\\n(<https://mbg.au.dk/yuya-hayashi/>)\n\n#### Access\n\nThrough collaborations",
