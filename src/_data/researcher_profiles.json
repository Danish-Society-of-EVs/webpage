      "description": "## A Zebrafish Approach to Extracellular Vesicle Biology\n\n### EV Expertise\n\nmiRNA, Protein, EV-protein corona, EV characterization, EV imaging\n\n### Affiliation\n\nAssociate Professor\\\nDepartment of Molecular Biology and Genetics\\\n& Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (iNANO)\n\n### Censor Corps\n\nNo\n\n### MOVE Host\n\nYes\n\n### Research Area\n\nWe study EVs as the new frontier of cell-to-cell communication. For example, by which mechanisms can EVs find the target recipient cells via the bloodstream? What kind of messages are conveyed to regulate/support the recipient cells? With zebrafish as our little partners, we seek answers to these questions by nanoscience approaches, bioinformatics and 4D imaging of live transgenic embryos.\n\n### Key Publications\n\nPlatelet-derived extracellular vesicles home in on macrophages and trigger immune responses\n\n> \"Beyond Basic Characterization and Omics: Immunomodulatory Roles of Platelet-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Unveiled by Functional Testing\"\\\n> Journal of Extracellular Vesicles 13. e12513. 2024.
