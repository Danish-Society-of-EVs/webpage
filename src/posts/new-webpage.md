## What happened?

Our previous webpage was hosted using Wordpress. Unfortunately, the installation was corrupted causing the entire webpage to become defective. We were not able to restore the site from a backup.

## Our new website

The new version of www.DSEV.dk is coded using much better tooling and will never become defective. Some features from the old webpage might not yet be available, however, they will be added as soon as they become ready. 

You can view the source code for the webpage on [GitHub](https://github.com/Danish-Society-of-EVs/webpage/tree/develop "GitHub").
