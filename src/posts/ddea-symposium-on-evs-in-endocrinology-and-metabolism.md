This [DDEA Symposium on Endocrinology and Metabolism](https://ddeacademy.dk/events/extracellular-vesicles-endocrinology-and-metabolism) brings together clinical, basic, and translational scientists, at all career levels, engaged or interested in extracellular vesicles (EV). We aim to facilitate increased awareness of both the prospects and the limitations of extracellular vesicles in the clinical audience, and to highlight endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism as future areas of interest in EV-related research.
