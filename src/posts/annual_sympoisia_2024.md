Registration and abstract submission for the 5th Annual meeting at DSEV are now open!

## Registration
Registration for the symposium is linked to a DSEV membership, and the payment of the membership fee of DKK 200 will grant you voting access to the DSEV General Assembly, which takes place during the symposium. This fee also covers breakfast, coffee, and lunch at the symposium. However, if you want to participate in the evening dinner at 7 pm, it will cost an additional DKK 100. Please select "Registration Only" if no abstract is to be submitted.

## Payment
**[*Important*] BEFORE registration, please pay the fees upfront** to DSEV's bank account: reg no. 9070 account no. 2075432421 with your name indicated in the bank transfer. The date of the payment is needed during the registration process. Group payment is accepted through an electronic invoice. In this case, instead of the payment date, please indicate the name of the person in charge to whom an invoice for the group payment will be sent. Please contact Jonas Ellegaard Nielsen (j.ellegaard@rn.dk) if you need assistance.

## Abstract submission

All abstracts will be reviewed and selected for oral or poster presentation (please indicate your preference during abstract submission). Note that registration is required when you submit an abstract. Please select "Registration + Abstract Submission".
