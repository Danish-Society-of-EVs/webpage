## Registration

This year, we have created a questionnaire along with the registration form. Please allow 10-15 min to complete both of the registration process and questionnaire.

### **How to sign up**

This is the single-point entry form for registration with or without abstract submission.

* Please select "Registration + Abstract Submission" for submitting an abstract.
* Please select "Registration Only" if no abstract is to be submitted.

### **Registration fee**

Registration for the symposium is linked to a DSEV membership, and the payment of the membership fee of DKK 200 will grant you voting access to the DSEV General Assembly, which takes place during the symposium. This fee also covers breakfast, coffee, and lunch at the symposium. However, if you want to participate in the evening dinner at 7 pm, it will cost an additional DKK 100.

### **Individual payment – bank transfer**

\[Important] BEFORE registration, please pay the fees upfront to DSEV's bank account: reg no. 9070 account no. 2075432421 with your name indicated in the bank transfer. The date of the payment is needed during the registration process.

### **Group payment – electronic invoice**

Group payment is accepted through an electronic invoice sent to a single person in charge of the payment on behalf of the group. During the registration process, please indicate the name of the person in charge.

\[Important] WHEN all group participants are registered, the responsible person should contact the Treasurer Jonas Ellegaard Mortensen (j.ellegaard@rn.dk) specifying EAN and the total number of group participants, with or without the dinner option, to trigger an electronic invoice.

## **Abstract submission**

To promote networking across institutions, you are strongly encouraged to submit an abstract, including abstracts for posters presented at other events. All abstracts will be reviewed and selected for oral or poster presentation (please indicate your preference during abstract submission). Note that registration is required when you submit an abstract.
