In this project, deep characterization and upscaling of *A. galli* EV production are pursued using combined differential centrifugation and size exclusion chromatography to improve EV yield, purity, and biological integrity. Isolation of EVs from fecal samples is also addressed, building on protocols developed by the host group and enabling analysis of parasite- and host-derived EVs under natural infection conditions. Access to the advanced EV isolation expertise and standardized methodologies available in Tartu is therefore considered essential to overcome current bottlenecks, enable antigen discovery, and support future comparative EV analyses across parasites and host systems."
